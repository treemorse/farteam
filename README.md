# Abstract
During the last few years the fitness industry has experienced a significant decrease in revenue due to the pandemic[1].
While many fitness employees were being laid off[2], virtual training, home gyms and outdoor exercise became extremely popular[1]. 
</br></br>
Based on this data, an assumption can be made that currently, the demand for fitness lessons from experienced instructors exceeds the supply.
This project's purpose is to provide jobs for fitness coaches, as well as to create an environment for ex gym members
to communicate with professional fitness instructors.
</br></br>
In order to achieve this goal, I have created a cross-platform mobile app for fitness instructors and their potential clients.
The main function of the app is a lesson-builder feature, which provides the users with an opportunity to specify the type 
of fitness lessons they want to give/take. To establish frictionless communication between users, this information, 
combined with a link to its creator, is placed on a map based on the specified location in the form of a pinpoint.

Due to the lack of gyms caused by the pandemic and with the help of technological improvements in internet connectivity and streaming, virtual fitness services such as Peloton are increasingly becoming very popular.
